## CS2 Config Shit

### Video Settings
#### Step 1:
Go to "Steam\userdata\<YOUR ID>\730\local\cfg"
Create a backup of your old "cs2_video.txt" (just rename it to "cs2_video.txt.old" or smth)
#### Step 2:
Download my "cs2_video.txt" or copy the content of it in a new "cs2_video.txt"
inside of the "cs2_video.txt" change 
```
"DeviceID"		"<YOUR ID>"

to your "DeviceID" on line 5, you can find your "DeviceID" in your old "cs2_video.txt".
